    "# MAPPING AFRICA'S CONFLICT RELATIONSHIPS\n",
    "\n",
    "**An exploration of actor-to-actor conflict dynamics across the African continent (1997–2014) using ACLED Dyadic Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding  \n",
    "In Africa’s conflict zones, it’s not just about what happened- it’s about **who keeps coming back to fight whom**, and **where things are heating up**.  \n",
    "That’s the part most datasets skip. But the ACLED Dyadic data? That’s where the real signal lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re not here to count bullets. We’re here to **map relationships**, **track escalations**, and surface the patterns that matter- before things spiral.  \n",
    "This project leans into that gap- turning actor-to-actor conflict data into something **actionable** for NGOs, peacebuilders, analysts, and anyone serious about understanding violence from the inside out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview  \n",
    "We’re breaking down over a decade of conflict- **who fought whom**, **where**, and **how it played out**- to answer the questions that lead to better decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What dyads keep reappearing?\n",
    "- Who’s triggering the worst violence?\n",
    "- Which areas are consistently volatile?\n",
    "- How do these relationships evolve?\n",
    "\n",
    "From mapping conflict webs to scoring high-risk actor pairs, the goal is simple:  \n",
    "**Give the right people the right lens before the next crisis hits.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cleaned + enriched dataset** (dyad ID, conflict region, actor normalization, year breakdown)\n",
    "- **Conflict dyad explorer**- who fights whom, how often, and with what impact\n",
    "- **Escalation curves** for the most volatile dyads\n",
    "- **Hotspot heatmaps** and regional breakdowns\n",
    "- **Network graphs** showing actor relationships and central nodes\n",
    "- **Dyadic Risk Score**- composite risk index based on frequency, intensity, and recency\n",
    "- **Notebooks + visuals + ready-to-use summaries** for stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Top 10 riskiest dyads identified and profiled  \n",
    "- Escalation trends clearly visualized for key actor pairs  \n",
    "- Accurate hotspot detection by region and year  \n",
    "- Reusable code and clean outputs for policy teams or analysts  \n",
    "- Project structured for future ACLED updates or country- focused expansions  \n",
    "\n",
    "> This isn’t just a dataset. It’s a lens. One that tells us not just what happened- **but who’s likely to make it happen again.**\n",
    "> Powered by data. Grounded in people."

    "## INITIAL DATA EXPLORATION (IDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every dataset tells a story- but before I dive into any narratives, I'll flip through the table of contents. This phase is about getting comfortable with the data: seeing what’s there, what’s missing, and what might surprise me later if I don’t pay attention now.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's happening:\n",
    "- Importing key libraries like 'pandas', 'numpy', 'seaborn', 'matplotlib', and 'plotly'- the usual suspects for slicing, dicing and visualizing data.\n",
    "- Previewing the first few rows to get a feel for the dataset’s structure, naming conventions, and early red flags (no one likes nasty surprises 30 cells in).\n",
    "- Checking the shape of the data because whether it's 500 rows or 50,000 completely changes the game.\n",
    "- Get metadata\n",
    "- Get basic statistics information of both numerica and categorical columns\n",
    "\n",
    "This might not be the flashiest part of the workflow, but it’s where trust is built- between me and the dataset. And as I’ve learned from previous projects, a few extra minutes spent here can save hours of confusion down the road.\n",

    "Exploration done right is part instinct, part structure- this is BOTH!"

    "# DATA UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we’re working with: a robust dataset of **99,548 conflict event records** spread across **25 columns**- a goldmine of information with just enough chaos to make it interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, it’s clear the data isn't just big- it's rich. We're talking detailed temporal, geographic, and actor-based breakdowns for every recorded incident. A few key highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temporal coverage:** Events range from **1997 to 2014**, with timestamp precision reaching down to the day level (event_date) and granularity flagged via time_precision.\n",
    "- **Spatial detail:** Latitude and longitude have no nulls, and we’ve got hierarchical administrative geographies (admin1, admin2, admin3)- though admin3 is a bit flaky with over **51K nulls**.\n",
    "- **Actors & Interactions:** actor1 and actor2 describe the primary participants in each event. Their allies? Less reliable. ally_actor_1 and ally_actor_2 are sparsely populated- **missing in over 85%** and **91%** of records respectively. Still, when they show up, they say a lot (*Muslim Brotherhood*, *MDC*, etc).\n",
    "- **Event context:** event_type spans **9 unique categories**, dominated by conflict like *\"Battle – No change of territory\"*. interaction codes encode the dance between actors- civilian vs. armed group, military vs. rebel, etc.\n",
    "- **Location hot zones:** *Mogadishu*, *Harare*, and *Banaadir* show up a lot- unsurprising, but still worth confirming with visuals.\n",
    "- **Fatalities:** Always the grim but vital metric. Recorded for most events (**95% coverage**), with counts ranging from **0 to 25,000**- yep, that’s not a typo. Definitely a candidate for outlier scrutiny.\n",

    "\n",
    "But here’s the kicker: it’s **sparse**- missing in over **85%** of records. Which means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes, it’s **truly unknown**.\n",
    "- More often, it’s **just not coded**, even when real-world alliances *did* exist.\n",
    "- Yet when it *is* recorded, it reveals **deep structural ties**- like ZANU-PF & war veterans, AMISOM backing local forces, or student groups fueling civil resistance.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In ACLED's dyadic data structure, every event is coded with up to **two actors**:  \n",
    "- actor1: the initiator or primary aggressor  \n",
    "- actor2: the opponent, target, or secondary party (if any)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in our dataset, over **22,000 records** (22%) are missing actor2. But according to ACLED’s own documentation, this isn’t a glitch- it’s by design.\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Events are coded with as much detail as is available; when an actor is unknown, unidentified, or the event only involves one side (e.g., protests, attacks on civilians), the second actor field is left blank.” - *ACLED Methodology*\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Missing actor2 Really Means\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we’re not just dealing with dirty data - we’re looking at a **coded absence**. Here’s what it could mean in ACLED’s terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unopposed action** → No counter-party (e.g forced evictions, one-sided violence)\n",
    "- **Unknown target** → E.g bombings or abductions with no reported victim group\n",
    "- **Symbolic/strategic events** → Raids, looting, or property destruction not tied to a known adversary\n",
    "- **Crowd-led unrest** → Protests, riots, or demonstrations with no clear ‘opponent’\n",
    "\n",
    "Also worth noting: where actor2 *is* recorded, it’s dominated by **civilians** - a clear pattern that aligns with ACLED’s heavy inclusion of civilian-targeted violence across African states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So How Should We Handle It?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What we *won’t* do:\n",
    "- Drop these records - they’re **intentionally included by ACLED**\n",
    "- Impute with the mode (‘Civilians’) - that risks fabricating dyads and corrupting network structure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What we’ll do instead:\n",

    "This field has over **90,000 missing entries**, which means it's missing in **91%** of the dataset. But again, this isn’t broken data - it’s intentional. And ACLED’s documentation gives us the context:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Allies are coded only if explicitly mentioned as participating in the event. If no alliance or co-action is reported, the field is left blank.” - *ACLED Methodology*\n",
    "\n",
    "So, ally_actor_2 isn’t a required field - it’s **bonus intelligence**. When it shows up, it means a secondary affiliation or support structure was clearly recorded for actor2. When it’s blank, it usually just means there was **no reported ally** - not that something’s missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Do We Actually See?\n",
    "\n",
    "Where 'ally_actor_2' *is* recorded, it’s powerful stuff:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Political coalitions**: MDC & MDC-T in Zimbabwe, PDP in Nigeria  \n",
    "- **Peacekeeping and international actors**: AMISOM, refugees, IDPs  \n",
    "- **Religious groups, militias, and civic alliances**: Muslim Brotherhood, Masvingo Residents’ Trust, journalists and street traders\n",
    "\n",
    "These aren’t just side mentions - they’re part of the **conflict structure**. Whether it’s coordination, reinforcement, or just ideological alignment, these allies change the meaning and interpretation of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We’ll Do\n",
    "\n",
    "As with ally_actor_1, we’re not here to fill in fantasy allies. We're keeping it real - and **explicitly surfacing the absence** to preserve meaning."
