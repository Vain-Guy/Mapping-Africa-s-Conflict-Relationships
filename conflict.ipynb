    "# MAPPING AFRICA'S CONFLICT RELATIONSHIPS\n",
    "\n",
    "**An exploration of actor-to-actor conflict dynamics across the African continent (1997–2014) using ACLED Dyadic Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding  \n",
    "In Africa’s conflict zones, it’s not just about what happened- it’s about **who keeps coming back to fight whom**, and **where things are heating up**.  \n",
    "That’s the part most datasets skip. But the ACLED Dyadic data? That’s where the real signal lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re not here to count bullets. We’re here to **map relationships**, **track escalations**, and surface the patterns that matter- before things spiral.  \n",
    "This project leans into that gap- turning actor-to-actor conflict data into something **actionable** for NGOs, peacebuilders, analysts, and anyone serious about understanding violence from the inside out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview  \n",
    "We’re breaking down over a decade of conflict- **who fought whom**, **where**, and **how it played out**- to answer the questions that lead to better decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What dyads keep reappearing?\n",
    "- Who’s triggering the worst violence?\n",
    "- Which areas are consistently volatile?\n",
    "- How do these relationships evolve?\n",
    "\n",
    "From mapping conflict webs to scoring high-risk actor pairs, the goal is simple:  \n",
    "**Give the right people the right lens before the next crisis hits.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cleaned + enriched dataset** (dyad ID, conflict region, actor normalization, year breakdown)\n",
    "- **Conflict dyad explorer**- who fights whom, how often, and with what impact\n",
    "- **Escalation curves** for the most volatile dyads\n",
    "- **Hotspot heatmaps** and regional breakdowns\n",
    "- **Network graphs** showing actor relationships and central nodes\n",
    "- **Dyadic Risk Score**- composite risk index based on frequency, intensity, and recency\n",
    "- **Notebooks + visuals + ready-to-use summaries** for stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Top 10 riskiest dyads identified and profiled  \n",
    "- Escalation trends clearly visualized for key actor pairs  \n",
    "- Accurate hotspot detection by region and year  \n",
    "- Reusable code and clean outputs for policy teams or analysts  \n",
    "- Project structured for future ACLED updates or country- focused expansions  \n",
    "\n",
    "> This isn’t just a dataset. It’s a lens. One that tells us not just what happened- **but who’s likely to make it happen again.**\n",
    "> Powered by data. Grounded in people."

    "## INITIAL DATA EXPLORATION (IDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every dataset tells a story- but before I dive into any narratives, I'll flip through the table of contents. This phase is about getting comfortable with the data: seeing what’s there, what’s missing, and what might surprise me later if I don’t pay attention now.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's happening:\n",
    "- Importing key libraries like 'pandas', 'numpy', 'seaborn', 'matplotlib', and 'plotly'- the usual suspects for slicing, dicing and visualizing data.\n",
    "- Previewing the first few rows to get a feel for the dataset’s structure, naming conventions, and early red flags (no one likes nasty surprises 30 cells in).\n",
    "- Checking the shape of the data because whether it's 500 rows or 50,000 completely changes the game.\n",
    "- Get metadata\n",
    "- Get basic statistics information of both numerica and categorical columns\n",
    "\n",
    "This might not be the flashiest part of the workflow, but it’s where trust is built- between me and the dataset. And as I’ve learned from previous projects, a few extra minutes spent here can save hours of confusion down the road.\n",

    "# DATA UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we’re working with: a robust dataset of **99,548 conflict event records** spread across **25 columns**- a goldmine of information with just enough chaos to make it interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, it’s clear the data isn't just big- it's rich. We're talking detailed temporal, geographic, and actor-based breakdowns for every recorded incident. A few key highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temporal coverage:** Events range from **1997 to 2014**, with timestamp precision reaching down to the day level (event_date) and granularity flagged via time_precision.\n",
    "- **Spatial detail:** Latitude and longitude have no nulls, and we’ve got hierarchical administrative geographies (admin1, admin2, admin3)- though admin3 is a bit flaky with over **51K nulls**.\n",
    "- **Actors & Interactions:** actor1 and actor2 describe the primary participants in each event. Their allies? Less reliable. ally_actor_1 and ally_actor_2 are sparsely populated- **missing in over 85%** and **91%** of records respectively. Still, when they show up, they say a lot (*Muslim Brotherhood*, *MDC*, etc).\n",
    "- **Event context:** event_type spans **9 unique categories**, dominated by conflict like *\"Battle – No change of territory\"*. interaction codes encode the dance between actors- civilian vs. armed group, military vs. rebel, etc.\n",
    "- **Location hot zones:** *Mogadishu*, *Harare*, and *Banaadir* show up a lot- unsurprising, but still worth confirming with visuals.\n",
    "- **Fatalities:** Always the grim but vital metric. Recorded for most events (**95% coverage**), with counts ranging from **0 to 25,000**- yep, that’s not a typo. Definitely a candidate for outlier scrutiny.\n",

    "- latitude/longitude - geographically grounded, no junk entries.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "But here’s the kicker: it’s **sparse**- missing in over **85%** of records. Which means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes, it’s **truly unknown**.\n",
    "- More often, it’s **just not coded**, even when real-world alliances *did* exist.\n",
    "- Yet when it *is* recorded, it reveals **deep structural ties**- like ZANU-PF & war veterans, AMISOM backing local forces, or student groups fueling civil resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we handle this field?  \n",
    "It’s not cosmetic- it’s **strategic**. Because in an analysis like this- where **relationships *are* the data**, not just attributes- we can’t afford to flatten the network.\n",

    "\n",
    "ally_actor_1 is 85% missing. But when it's there, it’s gold- it tells us who’s moving in packs, who’s propping up whom, and how certain actors may not act alone.\n",

    "In ACLED's dyadic data structure, every event is coded with up to **two actors**:  \n",
    "- actor1: the initiator or primary aggressor  \n",
    "- actor2: the opponent, target, or secondary party (if any)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in our dataset, over **22,000 records** (22%) are missing actor2. But according to ACLED’s own documentation, this isn’t a glitch- it’s by design.\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Events are coded with as much detail as is available; when an actor is unknown, unidentified, or the event only involves one side (e.g., protests, attacks on civilians), the second actor field is left blank.” - *ACLED Methodology*\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Missing actor2 Really Means\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we’re not just dealing with dirty data - we’re looking at a **coded absence**. Here’s what it could mean in ACLED’s terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unopposed action** → No counter-party (e.g forced evictions, one-sided violence)\n",
    "- **Unknown target** → E.g bombings or abductions with no reported victim group\n",
    "- **Symbolic/strategic events** → Raids, looting, or property destruction not tied to a known adversary\n",
    "- **Crowd-led unrest** → Protests, riots, or demonstrations with no clear ‘opponent’\n",
    "\n",
    "Also worth noting: where actor2 *is* recorded, it’s dominated by **civilians** - a clear pattern that aligns with ACLED’s heavy inclusion of civilian-targeted violence across African states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So How Should We Handle It?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What we *won’t* do:\n",
    "- Drop these records - they’re **intentionally included by ACLED**\n",
    "- Impute with the mode (‘Civilians’) - that risks fabricating dyads and corrupting network structure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What we’ll do instead:\n",

    "This field has over **90,000 missing entries**, which means it's missing in **91%** of the dataset. But again, this isn’t broken data - it’s intentional. And ACLED’s documentation gives us the context:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Allies are coded only if explicitly mentioned as participating in the event. If no alliance or co-action is reported, the field is left blank.” - *ACLED Methodology*\n",
    "\n",
    "So, ally_actor_2 isn’t a required field - it’s **bonus intelligence**. When it shows up, it means a secondary affiliation or support structure was clearly recorded for actor2. When it’s blank, it usually just means there was **no reported ally** - not that something’s missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Do We Actually See?\n",
    "\n",
    "Where 'ally_actor_2' *is* recorded, it’s powerful stuff:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Political coalitions**: MDC & MDC-T in Zimbabwe, PDP in Nigeria  \n",
    "- **Peacekeeping and international actors**: AMISOM, refugees, IDPs  \n",
    "- **Religious groups, militias, and civic alliances**: Muslim Brotherhood, Masvingo Residents’ Trust, journalists and street traders\n",
    "\n",
    "These aren’t just side mentions - they’re part of the **conflict structure**. Whether it’s coordination, reinforcement, or just ideological alignment, these allies change the meaning and interpretation of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We’ll Do\n",
    "\n",
    "As with ally_actor_1, we’re not here to fill in fantasy allies. We're keeping it real - and **explicitly surfacing the absence** to preserve meaning."

    "'admin' is short for *administration*\n",

    "In conflict data, **location isn’t just about coordinates** - it’s about **territory, power, and jurisdiction**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where ACLED’s admin fields come in. They don’t just tell us where something happened on a map - they tell us **where it happened politically**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So, What Are These Fields?\n",
    "\n",
    "ACLED uses three levels of administrative geography:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column   | Represents                                     | Example (Kenya)           |\n",
    "|----------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n",
    "| admin1   | First-level division - *province*, *region*, or *state*     | Nairobi County             |\n",
    "| admin2   | Second-level division -  *district*, *county*, or *municipality* | Westlands Sub-County       |\n",
    "| admin3   | Third-level division - *ward*, *zone*, *division*, etc.     | Kitisuru Ward              |\n",
    "\n",
    "These follow each country’s own hierarchy, based on datasets like **GADM**, **OCHA**, or **national census boundaries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to conflict, **place matters** - not just as dots on a map, but as zones of influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- admin1 helps us **see regional trends** (e.g is violence concentrated in eastern provinces?)\n",
    "- admin2 lets us **localize risks** (which counties or districts are repeatedly affected?)\n",
    "- admin3 gives us **granular insight**, when available (targeted wards, neighborhoods)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if lat/lon gives you the \"where,\" admin tells you **\"whose turf\"** it is - and that’s crucial when mapping conflict dynamics, escalation zones, or intervention impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Talk: Sparse admin3\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every event will have a clean admin3 value. In many countries, it’s blank in large chunks. That doesn’t mean the data’s broken - it just reflects **variations in reporting or geocoding precision**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ACLED’s admin columns let you zoom in from country → region → local hot zone, without ever losing the political context.\n",
    "\n",
    "When mapping human conflict, **context is everything**."

    "### Imputing admin2: Strategic, Not Cosmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, 3,379 missing values in admin2 might seem like a minor nuisance - just 3.4% of the dataset. But when mapping conflict geographies, even a small gap in spatial granularity can mislead or obscure patterns. So we don’t shrug this off. We investigate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn’t about patching a column - it’s about deciding what spatial resolution we can trust, and where we can’t afford to fake it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Could We Impute admin2 Smartly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes - because **other fields carry the signal** we need. And they’re fully intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### location: Our First Clue\n",
    "location is complete - zero missing values. That makes it our best friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can mine the dataset for **consistent mappings between location and admin2. If “Baydhabo” appears 200 times, and 198 of those times it maps to “Baydhabo” as admin2, we’ve got a 99% confidence case to fill the missing two.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn’t guesswork - it’s **data-driven inference** based on internal consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### admin1: A Structural Filter\n",
    "admin1 is also 100% complete. That gives us a second layer of logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a location maps to two possible admin2 values depending on admin1, we **filter by region** to eliminate ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This layered validation ensures we don’t assign a sub-county to the wrong province.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Latitude & Longitude: Precision Tools\n",
    "Every row has coordinates - which means in theory, we could reverse-geocode events into admin boundaries using shapefiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s **high effort, high reward**, and best suited for GIS integration. For now, we'll only consider it if location fails us.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Won’t Do\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re not bulk-filling with the mode, and we’re not faking granularity where it doesn’t exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t impute from actor, interaction, or other unrelated fields. This isn’t a regression problem. It’s a **geopolitical integrity** problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll apply **hierarchical, confidence-based imputation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary Strategy**: Impute missing admin2 from location when there's a strong, consistent match (≥ 95% confidence)\n",
    "2. **Filtered Check**: Validate each match against admin1 to avoid spatial mismatch\n",
    "3. **Fallback**: Leave remaining values as 'No recorded admin2', and flag them with 'has_admin2 = 0'\n",
    "\n",
    "This keeps our dataset **clean**, **honest**, and **geo-aware** - ready for hotspot maps, spatial clustering, and conflict flow modeling."

    "### Cleaning Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The notes column is a goldmine. It gives unstructured but highly descriptive insights into events: who did what, where, how, and to whom. But like any field that pulls from thousands of sources and regions, it's noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "And in international conflict data? That noise matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Understand the Mess\n",
    "\n",
    "We found over **10,000 missing entries**, plus plenty of vague or lazy placeholders like:\n",
    "- \"base\"\n",
    "- \"see original data\"\n",
    "- \" \" (just spaces)\n",
    "- \"NaN\" or literal 'None'\n",
    "- Variants like \"Base\" or \"no recorded notes\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Those aren’t insights - they’re just empty calories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Fill Gaps Carefully\n",
    "\n",
    "We started by:\n",
    "- Filling nulls with a **standard marker**: \"no recorded notes\"\n",
    "- Lowercasing everything for consistency\n",
    "- Stripping whitespace and removing **excessive spacing**, common in multi-language, multi-source entries\n",
    "\n",
    "This let us spot duplicates and clean out irrelevant junk.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Define “Meaningful”\n",
    "\n",
    "If an entry was one of our known placeholders - or even started with \"see original data\" - we flagged it as non-informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything else? Kept\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Track the Cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "We added:\n",
    "- notes_cleaned: our normalized version\n",
    "- has_notes: a binary flag so you can filter or group by data quality\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we can easily distinguish between actual event narratives vs filler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn’t impute or hallucinate any “notes” content.\n",
    "\n",
    "In unstructured fields like this, preserving what’s real is more important than pretending we know what’s not. That’s especially true in data used for things like conflict forecasting, early warning, or human rights reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn’t just clean the column. We kept the signal, and dropped the noise."

    "- We create:\n",
    "  - fatalities_filled: a version where **missing values is set to 0** - not to rewrite history, but to help downstream tools that require non-null numeric input.\n",
    "  - has_fatalities: a binary flag showing whether the value was **explicitly recorded**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lets us choose:  \n",
    "Use the raw data when investigating truth.  \n",
    "Use the filled version when modeling - **but always with awareness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Blank doesn’t mean zero.  \n",
    "But sometimes, for practical purposes, you need to fill it anyway — as long as you don’t forget it was blank in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, we gave both:\n",
    "- The **truth** (missing means unknown)\n",
    "- And the **tools** to work with it responsibly\n",
    "\n",
    "No inflation. No erasure. Just the facts, and the flag."

    "- A civilian actor → involves_civilian\n",

    "### Conflict Severity\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to conflict data, not all events carry the same weight. A peaceful protest and a deadly ambush may both be “events,” but the impact — on people, policy, and society - couldn’t be more different.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why we're not didn’t just count events. We engineer **conflict severity**: a feature that reflects the **scale, intensity, and seriousness** of each event in a principled way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "We craft a 'conflict_intensity_score' using three core ingredients:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event Type** - not all conflict is created equal  \n",
    "   - Some events are inherently more severe (e.g battles vs. protests)\n",
    "   - We assigned custom **severity weights** to event types\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fatalities** - a grounded indicator of violence  \n",
    "   - But fatalities are skewed: a few events dominate the totals  \n",
    "   - So we will log-transformed them for stability: 'log_fatalities = log(fatalities + 1)'\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Actors Involved** – some actors raise the stakes  \n",
    "   - We add binary flags:\n",
    "     - 'involves_state_actor'\n",
    "     - 'involves_rebel_actor'\n",
    "     - 'has_opposing_actor' (i.e a confrontation occurred)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "We assign severity weights like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Event Type                              | Severity |\n",
    "|----------------------------------------|----------|\n",
    "| Battle (any type)                      | 5        |\n",
    "| Remote violence                        | 4        |\n",
    "| Violence against civilians             | 3        |\n",
    "| Riots/Protests                         | 2        |\n",
    "| Non-violent activity / base / transfer | 1        |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasoning\n",
    "We avoid simplistic metrics like “just fatalities” because:\n",
    "- Fatalities are often under-reported or disputed\n",
    "- Not all harm is physical - e.g violent protests, abductions, displacement\n",
    "- Some highly disruptive events report zero fatalities\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, we don’t blindly rely on actor names. We group actors by roles (state, rebel, civilian, international, unknown) to avoid bias toward better-documented actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome\n",
    "Every event now has a conflict_intensity_score between ~1 and ~15+.\n",
    "This feature is:\n",
    "- Numerical - ready for clustering, modeling, and risk scoring\n",
    "- Interpretable - higher = more severe\n",
    "- Customizable - future analysts can re-weight components for specific use cases (e.g humanitarian triage, peacekeeping prioritization)"
