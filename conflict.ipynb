    "# MAPPING AFRICA'S CONFLICT RELATIONSHIPS\n",
    "\n",
    "**An exploration of actor-to-actor conflict dynamics across the African continent (1997–2014) using ACLED Dyadic Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding  \n",
    "In Africa’s conflict zones, it’s not just about what happened- it’s about **who keeps coming back to fight whom**, and **where things are heating up**.  \n",
    "That’s the part most datasets skip. But the ACLED Dyadic data? That’s where the real signal lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re not here to count bullets. We’re here to **map relationships**, **track escalations**, and surface the patterns that matter- before things spiral.  \n",
    "This project leans into that gap- turning actor-to-actor conflict data into something **actionable** for NGOs, peacebuilders, analysts, and anyone serious about understanding violence from the inside out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview  \n",
    "We’re breaking down over a decade of conflict- **who fought whom**, **where**, and **how it played out**- to answer the questions that lead to better decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What dyads keep reappearing?\n",
    "- Who’s triggering the worst violence?\n",
    "- Which areas are consistently volatile?\n",
    "- How do these relationships evolve?\n",
    "\n",
    "From mapping conflict webs to scoring high-risk actor pairs, the goal is simple:  \n",
    "**Give the right people the right lens before the next crisis hits.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cleaned + enriched dataset** (dyad ID, conflict region, actor normalization, year breakdown)\n",
    "- **Conflict dyad explorer**- who fights whom, how often, and with what impact\n",
    "- **Escalation curves** for the most volatile dyads\n",
    "- **Hotspot heatmaps** and regional breakdowns\n",
    "- **Network graphs** showing actor relationships and central nodes\n",
    "- **Dyadic Risk Score**- composite risk index based on frequency, intensity, and recency\n",
    "- **Notebooks + visuals + ready-to-use summaries** for stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Top 10 riskiest dyads identified and profiled  \n",
    "- Escalation trends clearly visualized for key actor pairs  \n",
    "- Accurate hotspot detection by region and year  \n",
    "- Reusable code and clean outputs for policy teams or analysts  \n",
    "- Project structured for future ACLED updates or country- focused expansions  \n",
    "\n",
    "> This isn’t just a dataset. It’s a lens. One that tells us not just what happened- **but who’s likely to make it happen again.**\n",
    "> Powered by data. Grounded in people."

    "## INITIAL DATA EXPLORATION (IDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every dataset tells a story- but before I dive into any narratives, I'll flip through the table of contents. This phase is about getting comfortable with the data: seeing what’s there, what’s missing, and what might surprise me later if I don’t pay attention now.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's happening:\n",
    "- Importing key libraries like 'pandas', 'numpy', 'seaborn', 'matplotlib', and 'plotly'- the usual suspects for slicing, dicing and visualizing data.\n",
    "- Previewing the first few rows to get a feel for the dataset’s structure, naming conventions, and early red flags (no one likes nasty surprises 30 cells in).\n",
    "- Checking the shape of the data because whether it's 500 rows or 50,000 completely changes the game.\n",
    "- Get metadata\n",
    "- Get basic statistics information of both numerica and categorical columns\n",
    "\n",
    "This might not be the flashiest part of the workflow, but it’s where trust is built- between me and the dataset. And as I’ve learned from previous projects, a few extra minutes spent here can save hours of confusion down the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploration done right is part instinct, part structure- this is BOTH!"
