# Mapping Africa's Conflict Relationships

### Example Scenario: Ground-Level Relevance

> **Fatima**, a field coordinator for an international NGO in the Sahel, is tasked with preparing a conflict-risk report for an upcoming health deployment in **northern Mali**.  
> Her concern isn’t just *whether* violence is happening—it’s **who’s behind it**, **who’s being targeted**, and **whether this pattern is intensifying**.  

> By analyzing dyadic conflict data, she learns that:
> - **Actor1**: *Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM)*  
> - **Actor2**: *Malian Military Forces*  
> - Have been in repeated confrontations in the region  
> - With a **recent surge in frequency and fatalities**

> This insight allows Fatima to:
> - Reroute medical supply chains  
> - Brief her team on security vulnerabilities  
> - Advocate for localized ceasefire diplomacy  
> - And avoid deploying staff into a rapidly escalating zone

> **The result?** A faster, smarter humanitarian response—**before** the next flashpoint ignites.
